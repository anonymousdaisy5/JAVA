 fundamental points to remember-
(part1)

1. What is the output of the following code if the input is : 5 10 ?
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = s.nextInt();
int b = s.nextInt();
System.out.println(a+b);

ANSWER- Error
"s.nextInt()" scans and returns the next token as int. A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline.
So when input line is : “5 10”, then s.nextInt() returns the first token i.e. “5” as int and s.nextInt() again returns the next token i.e. “10” as int

2.What is the output of the following code if the input string is "Coding Ninjas"?
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String str;
str = s.next();
System.out.print(str);

ANSWER- Coding
s.next() returns the next token as String. A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline.
So when input line is - “Coding Ninjas” then s.next() returns the first token i.e. Coding

3.What is the output of the following code if input is :
10 abc def

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = s.nextInt();
String str = s.next();
System.out.print(a);
System.out.println(str);

ANSWER- 10abc
s.nextInt() scans and returns the next token as int. A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline. 
So when input line is - “10 abc def” then s.nextInt() returns the first token as int i.e. “10” and s.next() returns the next token "abc”. 
While printing, in first statement a is printed and then str. There is no space or nextline between both print. Hence output is : 10abc.

4.What is the output of the following code if input is : abc def 10
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String str = s.next();
int a = s.nextInt();
System.out.print(str + " " + a);

ANSWER-  InputMismatchException

s.next()" scans and returns the next token as String. A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline.
So when input line is - “abc def 10” then s.next() returns the first token as String i.e. “abc” 
and s.nextInt() tries to convert the next token i.e. “def” into an int, which gives InputMismatchException.
